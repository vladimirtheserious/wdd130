    <h3>Home page</h3>
    <p>
    The basic idea of my site is very simple. Skate parks all over the world are gaining huge popularity. Every second, and maybe even third person in the world would like to ride a bike or roller in a specially equipped place for this. 
    Unfortunately, the skatepark is not accessible to everyone. Not every district, city or country has a skatepark. After all, to build a really good and safe skatepark is not an easy idea. It requires huge expenditures, sufficient materials and, above all, skilled hands.
    Thats why this project and my site was created. I work with my team to build safe skate parks. The uniqueness of the project lies in the fact that we build skateparks for both rich skateparks communities and low-income ones. 
    Our skateparks are characterized by excellent quality of the figures. The figures themselves are designed with care so that the skatepark is as safe as possible, including for children.

    <h3>Store</h3>
    <p>
        In this section you can see in detail the products that my team sells. You can see the price list for skatepark figures, approximate cost of works, how much time is necessary for building skateparks. 
        In addition, you can see the works of the artist in the Store section. In my team there are artists who beautifully decorate the drawings in the skate park itself. All this to make the skatepark look very beautiful, modern and alive. Artists can also apply a drawing to skateboards, wheels or pendants. The price list is also in the Store section. 
        Moreover, in the «Store» section you can buy all the necessary equipment for the skatepark. If you like rollerblading, BMX or skateboarding, you can buy all the necessary parts from us, and if the skateboard breaks, you can buy a board, suspension, wheels and change the broken parts to new ones right in our skateboard.
        In the store you can buy branded items with collections Vans, Nike SB, Fallen, Adidas and our personal brand of things such as T-shirts, backpacks, handles with branded logo 360 flip.
